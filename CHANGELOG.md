# linear-worktree

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- c70d0cc: Harden and simplify the CLI internals: surface shell failures as clean
  one-line errors, launch Claude with a `cwd` instead of `process.chdir`,
  isolate per-image download failures, add fetch timeouts, and derive the
  scratch directory from `os.tmpdir()` for portability. Refactors the git
  plumbing behind a small runner, warns when a configured Linear key still
  yields no issue, prunes the public API, and drops unused dependencies.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 036a360: Simplify repo detection to the current git repo or an explicit `--repo <path>`. The `~/.config/linear-worktree/repos.json` team map and the `LINEAR_WORKTREE_REPO` environment variable are no longer supported — run the command from inside the target repo, or pass `--repo` when outside it.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c4dc639: Launch each issue in a focused cmux workspace rooted at its worktree (with an inline fallback when cmux isn't running), so quitting Claude leaves you in the new directory. Claude now opens in plan mode with bypass permissions available via shift-tab (`--permission-mode plan --allow-dangerously-skip-permissions`).

  Startup is faster and no longer silent: the Linear fetch overlaps the `git fetch`, screenshots download in parallel, and each step prints progress to stderr. Multi-issue fan-out shows a per-issue `[x/total] ISSUE-ID` indicator. Worktree creation is now idempotent — re-running reuses an existing worktree and prunes stale registrations whose directories were deleted.

### Patch Changes

- 21435d6: Make the docs and examples org-neutral. README, skill references, and test fixtures now use placeholder team prefixes and repo paths instead of organisation-specific names, and the agent instructions drop a private migration note.
